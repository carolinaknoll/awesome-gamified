Awesome Gamified is a project with the idea of turning awesome lists like awesome-mental-health and awesome-programming into gamified experiences. As it is being developed, some of the current functionalities are saving the links you have already seen and showing them on a different screen for easy access.

The website is hosted via Github Pages, and you can view it [here](https://carolinaknoll.github.io/awesome-gamified/).
