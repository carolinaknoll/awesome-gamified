Awesome Gamified is a project with the idea of turning awesome lists like awesome-mental-health and awesome-programming into gamified experiences. 

### :eyeglasses: Contributing

The idea of this project is to find and develop creative ways to save, quantify and display progress on the various topics inside each Awesome list.

If you would like to help (and I will appreciate if you do!) and have different ideas other than the ones already implemented, please create an issue with your sugestion, a pull request or a code review. All feedback is welcome! :smile:

Thank you for taking your time to contribute! :bowtie:

### :eyeglasses: Running Awesome Gamified locally

As the project says, just follow the 1-2-3! That is, type the three commands below in your favorite command-line interface and you will be good to go. :smile:

1. Fork this repository by clicking the 'Fork' button on GitHub. Afterwards, clone your forked repository locally with: `git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/awesome-gamified.git`
2. Inside the repository's directory, install Awesome Gamified's dependencies: `npm i`
3. Now, all that's left is to start the engines! Finally, start up the project by running: `npm start`

Now, the project should automatically open on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and you will be able to see it and perform your desired changes. 

### :eyeglasses: Making changes

To change something, please create a branch from the `master` branch. Ideally, this branch should have the issue number in it. For example, if the issue you want to contribute is issue 10, and issue 10 is about making responsive changes, your branch should be named `10/responsive-changes`. Your branch name doesn't need to be big, just having one to three words is good enough.

While working win your changes, always commit on your created branch. When you're ready, create a pull request from your branch on your forked repository to `carolinaknoll/awesome-gamified:master`. You can do it quite easily if you refresh the GitHub page of your forked repository, because it will then recognize your changes and show you a yellow warning with a 'Create Pull Request' button. Just click on it and you will be good to go!

Try to be a bit descriptive on your Pull Request title and description, and if possible, write "Closes #xx", where the "xx" part is the number of the issue. When your PR is merged, the issue will close automatically, just like magic! :smile: 

When you're ready, submit your Pull Request and I will take a look at it as soon as possible. I try to always give feedback or merge requests on the same day on week days, but I don't usually work on the project during the weekend.

In any case, thank you for reading this contributing guide, and for your possible efforts to understand and contribute to the project! You rock! :rocket:
